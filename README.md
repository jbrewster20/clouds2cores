# Cloud2Cores: Analyzing Molecular Cloud Properties from LMT Observations

This project analyzes core catalogs from the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) to better understand the early stages of star formation. Rather than focusing solely on cloud-to-core transitions, the goal is to use the physical properties of dense cores to predict the types of stars or stellar populations they may formâ€”or whether they will collapse into stars at all.

## Project Highlights
- Analyze physical properties (e.g., mass, temperature, size) of dense cores and their molecular clouds
- Explore how environmental factors influence core evolution
- Create statistical plots (histograms, CDFs, scatter plots) to identify key trends and patterns

## Tools Used
- Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.)
- Object-oriented scripting
- FITS and CSV file handling
- Data visualization and interpretation
